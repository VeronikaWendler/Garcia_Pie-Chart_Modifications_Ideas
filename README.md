# Garcia_Pie-Chart_Modifications_Perception
I am currently conducting an experiment in Dr. Rama Charkavarthi's CAP lab at the Univeristy of Aberdeen involving modifications to the way uncertainty and probability are presented in pie charts. Does the lack of attention to experience, as seen in Garcia et al.'s (2022/23) research, stem from people's familiarity with conventional pie charts? How will the introduced abstractions affect people's perceptual decision-making?
