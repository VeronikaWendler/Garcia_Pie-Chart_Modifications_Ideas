# Garcia_Pie-Chart_Modifications_Perception
I'm working on an experiment to alter how uncertainty and probability are shown in pie charts. Could the oversight highlighted in Garcia et al.'s (2022/23) research be attributed to the familiarity people have with standard pie charts? How will these new abstractions impact people's decision-making based on perception?
